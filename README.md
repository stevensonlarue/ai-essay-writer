# looking inside

1. First, a person using the tool types in what they want their essay to be about. This could be anything like "The importance of saving water" or "How computers change our lives".

2. The tool then takes this topic and sends it to the AI part of the program. It's like telling a smart robot, "Hey, write something about this topic."

3. The AI, which is a really smart program, looks at the topic. It has been trained on lots of books, articles, and other essays, so it knows how to write. It thinks about the topic and starts creating an essay, making sure it makes sense and is interesting.

4. The AI writes the essay, one sentence at a time, making sure everything fits together well. It's like a very fast and smart writer who knows a lot about many topics.

5. Once the AI is done writing, the essay is sent back to the tool. Before showing it to the user, the tool might check if the essay is okay. It looks for things like if it's too long or if it's off-topic.

6. Finally, the essay is shown to the person who asked for it. They can read it and see if it's what they wanted. If it's good, they can use it. If not, they can ask the AI to try again or change some parts.

So, in simple words, the AI Essay Writer tool can be a smart assistant. You tell it what to write about, and it goes off, thinks about your topic, and writes an essay for you. Then it shows you the essay, and you decide if it's what you need.
